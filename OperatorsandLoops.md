### Operators And Loops

<hr>

#### Comparison and Logical Operators

**= =  is equal to**  This compares two values to see if they are the same
**! =  is not eaqual to**  This compares two values to see if they are not the same
**= = =  strict equal to** This compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
**! = = strict not equal to** This compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same
**> greater than**  This checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
**< less than** This checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
**> = greater than or equal to** This checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right
**< = less than or equal to** This checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right

#### Loops

Loops check conditions. If the loop returns true, a code block will run agin and it will keep repeating until the condition returns false. 

There are three common types of looos:
-For : Use for loop if you need to run a specific number of times.
-While : Does not have a counter and will continue to loop as long as the condition is ture.
-Do While : Will continue to loop at least once, even in the condition is false.
