#### How do computers work?

Computers process information by *taking input*, *storing information*, *processing information* and *producing output* results. This information is transfered by elctical signals giving the computer zeros and ones–– binary data. 

Computers are made of hardware and software. The hardware consists of:
-Wires
-Speakers
-Ports
-Chips
-Hard Drive

Software are the applications that are inside the computer, they are non tangible elements such as PowerPoint, Pages and games. 

There is a link between the hardware and software and that is called the "OS" which stands for operating system.
