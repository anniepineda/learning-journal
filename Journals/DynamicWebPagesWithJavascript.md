### Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript

<hr>

HTML, CSS and JavaScript all fit together to form beautiful websites. HTML acts as a content layer, CSS is the presentation layer and JavaScript is the behavioral layer that adds web interactivity. Each layer builds from the previous one and should be kept separated if possible. 

##### JavaScript's Objects & Methods
The **object** represents the entire web page, the **method** of the document allows new content to be written where the < script > sits. 

JavaScript uses variables and they are used as follow: 
**var quantity;**

var= variable keyword 
quantity= variable name

Variables are very helpful, they store information by using keywords. They are a type of shortcut.
