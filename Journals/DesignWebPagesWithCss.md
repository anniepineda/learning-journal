### Designing Web Pages With CSS

<hr>

CSS works with block-level elements and allows the creation of rules which control individual boxes and the way their content is presented. There are two types of rules in CSS; **selector** and a **declaration**. 

Selectors indicate to which elements the rules apply to.

Declarations indicate how an element should be sytled. Declarations have two parts, a property, and a value. 

#### Some Example Styles:
- Boxes: Width and height, Borders (color, width, and style) Background color and images Position in the browser window.

- Specific: There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables, and forms.
