 #### What is git?

 Git was born from the open-source software project Linux kernel, it was created by Linus Torvalds. Git is a distributed version control system that stores datea in a system of files. Think of this system like snapshots, each time there is a saved change Git creates a new file. This allows for little data loss–– a huge benefit. 

 #### Three Main Git Stages
 1. Committed (data is securly stored)
 2. Modified (file has been changed but not committed)
 3. Staged (to be committed in next snapshot)

#### Downloading Git
1. Install as a package
2. Install via another installer
3. Download and compile the source code.
