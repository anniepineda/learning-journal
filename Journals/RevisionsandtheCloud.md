### Learnings

<hr>

From lab 3 I learned how the importance of adding messages to the commit command. Making a note of why you made the changes instead of stating the changes made is a great way to keep track of issues and solutions. Also it can be very helpful when working in a group in that teammates can better understand why changes were made.
