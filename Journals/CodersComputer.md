### The Coders Computer

<hr>

Like an artist is careful and selective of the materials they use programmers are as well... There are many options available when it comes to choosing a text editor and it comes down to functionality and preference. 

#### What Is A Text Editor?

A text editor is software used to help a programmer manage text, particularly text used to build websites. 

#### What Features Are Important In A Text Editor?

- Code Completion (tries to finish your word before you are done typing it) 
- Syntax Highlighting (makes the text colorful and easier to read)
- Extension Selection (work like plugins that allow for different functionality)

#### "Cheat Sheet" For Terminal Use

1. user@bash: ls -1 /home/ryan
2. toal 3
3. drwxr-xr-x 2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
4. drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
5. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
6. user@bash:


*Line 1* presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).

*Lines 2 - 5* are output from running the command. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.

*Line 6* presents us with a prompt again. After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command the prompt will be displayed. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running (you will learn later how to deal with this).


#### "Cheat Sheet" Bash

1. user@bash: echo $SHELL
2. /bin/bash
3. user@bash
